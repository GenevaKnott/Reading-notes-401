###Readings: Cloud Identity and Access Management (IAM) with AWS

[Lessons Learned](https://www.zscaler.com/resources/white-papers/capital-one-data-breach.pdf)

1. What were the three commands used for the attack?

    The three commands issued for the attack Code:

    Get Credentials - First command when executed obtained security credentials known as ****-WAF-Role account (an IAM account) for an
    elevated role access AWS Web Application Firewall (WAF)

    List Buckets - Second command, when executed, used the security credentials *****-WAF-Role account to list files and folders (aka S3 buckets)
        
    Download Files - Third command, when executed used the *****-WAF-Role account to download files that were accessible by the credentials.


2. What misconfiguration of AWS components allowed the attacker to access sensitive data?

    According to AWS the attack occurred due to a misconfigured error at the application layer of a firewall installed by the financial institute. It also stated it was exacerbated by permissions that were likely broader than needed.

    "In summary, the most likely root cause of the attack was a poor security architecture design that exposed S3 buckets via AWS WAF/EC2 instance to anyone with an IAM role."

3. What are two of the AWS Governance practices that could have prevented such attack?

    AWS recommends a review of all access paths and permissions form human identities or non-human identities to data storage. They also recommend Cloud Infrastructure Management which automates the detection of over privileged identities and over-exposed data.

    AWS lists a few basics here: https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/secure-s3-resources/.
